IMMEDIATE TO-DO

-review the way that entity types are handled. there is almost certainly a better way to handle it than the currently
implemented method, probably making use of instanceof and possibly more general instantiation.

-add functions to allow for easier animation of entities, with different speeds
-add the option for entities to be text-based instead of using images
-clean up current codebase, and try to make things more elegant than they currently are
-bring everything into line with the PEP 8 guidelines. remember: this is meant to improve my python

-clean up game.py (move functions to outside files when possible)
-begin creating subclasses of Entity (starting with EntityUI and EntityGameplay)

ENTITY SYSTEM:

Anything that needs to be drawn on screen, handles any kind of logic separate from the main game loop, or serves some other temporary purpose,
is an entity. The player, enemies, walls, keys, doors, etc., are all examples of entities. However, not everything is the same object type.
Entity is the main entity object. It handles the primary functions: being created, being destroyed, updating, and handling the entity's image.
Entity itself will almost never be used specifically. Instead, subclasses of Entity, such as EntityPlayer, will be used instead, to add the
necessary functionality. There will be multiple layers of subclasses, to allow for ease of use. These are described below:

Entity:

the original entity object. handles creation, destruction, updating, and image handling.

    EntityUI:

    covers entities which will not move when the screen moves (healthbar, points [if added], player HUD), which will not be paused while the screen is moving,
    and will continue running when the game is paused. note- will never be solid (preventing player movement)

    EntityGameplay:

    covers entities which will move when the screen moves (changing stages), which will be paused when the screen is moving, and which will stop updating
    when the game is paused (or the gameplay state is paused)

        EntityActive:

        covers entities which have speed, friction (possibly?), acceleration, etc. This includes EntityPlayer

            EntityAlive:

            covers entities which have health, some form of damage, and which are destroyed when they lose their health. Includes EntityPlayer and EntityEnemy

                EntityPlayer:

                is the player object. handles movement for the player, as well as their attacks and dodges

                EntityEnemy:

                is the parent of all enemy entity types

        EntityWall:

        covers the walls which make up the game's stages
